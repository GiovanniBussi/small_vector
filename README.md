# small_vector
An implementation of small_vector (vector with a small buffer optimization). No dependencies. That was my main gripe with `boost::container::small_vector` and `llvm::SmallVector`. Performance is about on par with `boost::container::small_vector` from the small amount of testing I've done so far. This implementation also tries to mimic `std::vector` as much as possible in terms of top level member functions to allow drop-in replacement.
